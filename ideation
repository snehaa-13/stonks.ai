explanation ideation of the project here
here i will be building an ETL pipeline which will fetch stocks data forex and indian stock exchange data from free apis and then analyse the data and on the basis of that it will help the user 
to make decisions and investemnets in certain stocks and even help the user make profits, it will act like a personal stock portfolio generator where the user will
input his/her capital and also how much profit they want to make in how much time and then the software will fetch data do the analysis and give output to the user as to what stocks to invest in how much to invest and for how long ?
